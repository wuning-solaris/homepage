Biography
======
I am a master student of School of Computer Science and Engineering at Beihang University, advised by [Prof. Jingyuan Wang](https://https://www.bigscity.com/). I received Bachelor of Engineering from School of Computer Science and Engineering in Beihang University in 2018.07, majoring Computer Science and Engineering. I am also advised by [Prof. Wayne Xin Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JNhNacoAAAAJ&hl=en) on Recommendation System and Spatial Temporal Data Mining. I was an intern at Search and NLP Group of [Bytedance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/) working for Chinses Word Segmention during 2019 winter. I'm now a research intern at MSRA(Microsoft Research Asia) working on cross lingual pretraining.(Mentor: [Nan Duan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nanduan/) and [Yaobo Liang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yalia/)) During the internship, I also work closely with Bing QA Team@STCA(Software Technology Center Asia of Microsoft) led by [Ming Gong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ming-gong-8483449a/). 

Research Interests
======

I'm interested in Data Mining and Natural Languagle Processing and I have got several papers on these fields published. I have got a lot of experience on deep learning such as Recurent Neural Network(LSTM, GRU), Graph Neural Network, Transformers(Bert), etc. Also, I have a solid foundation on math and traditional computer science knowledge, which is the origin of my most ideas, such as the combination between A* algorithm and neural network and the combination between SMT(Statistic Machine Translation) and cross lingual pretraining(This paper is ongoing).

Working Experience
======
1. Bytedance, Search and Natural Language Processing Group, Intern, 2019.11-2020.1. During my internship, I participated in a chinese word segmentation project. We improve the chinese word segmentation significantly by finetuning a chinese bert and distilling it to a crf.
2. Microsoft Research Asia, Natural Language Computation Group, Intern, 2020.1-Now. My superivsor is [Nan Duan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nanduan/) and [Yaobo Liang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yalia/).  During my internship, I try to improve cross-lingual pretraining model by introducing word alignment of SMT~(Statistic Machine Translation) into crossing-lingual pretraining task. We constructed a new [cross-lingual understanding and generation benchmark](https://microsoft.github.io/XGLUE/), and proposed a state-of-the-art [cross-lingual pretraining model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01401.pdf).
